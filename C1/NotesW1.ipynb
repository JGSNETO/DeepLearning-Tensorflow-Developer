So given the data that we fed the model with, it calculated that there is a very high probability that the relationship between x and y is y=2x-1, but with only 6 data points we can't know for sure. As a result, the result for 10 is very close to 19, but not necessarily 19.\n","\n","- As you work with neural networks, you'll see this pattern recurring. You will almost always deal with probabilities, not certainties, and will do a little bit of coding to figure out what the result is based on the probabilities, particularly when it comes to classification."],"metadata":{"id":"53mFjxevDbtW"}}]}
